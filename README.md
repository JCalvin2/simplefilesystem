# simplefilesystem
simple CP/M File System
This program has a function that makes the Directory Struct (mkDirStruct) as well as one that writes the Directory Struct (writeDirStruct).
This takes the files on our given image file and makes the information readable to a user. The user can read as well as write to file. What follows are functions that make the FreeList and print out the FreeList in order to show the user what is available and what is taken on the drive. The next function cmDir shows what files are on the drive: names, extensions, and length(size). The functions cmRename and cmDelete allow for a file to be renamed and a file to be deleted as well. 

How to Run:
make
./cpmRun
